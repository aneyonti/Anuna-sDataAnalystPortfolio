# Anuna's - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi! I’m Anuna, a recent Master’s graduate in Business Analytics with a background in Economics. I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and using analytics to solve real-world business problems.

During my studies and projects, I’ve worked extensively with Python, Excel, and data visualization tools to analyze datasets, perform statistical analyses, and communicate findings effectively. I enjoy exploring datasets related to consumer behavior, marketing trends, and product reviews, and sharing insights that drive smarter decisions.
