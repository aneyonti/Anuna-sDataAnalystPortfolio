# Anuna's - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi! I’m Anuna, a recent Master’s graduate in Business Analytics with a background in Economics. I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and using analytics to solve real-world business problems.

During my studies and projects, I’ve worked extensively with Python, Excel, SQL, and data visualization tools to analyze datasets, perform statistical analyses, and communicate findings effectively. I enjoy exploring datasets related to consumer behavior/insights, marketing trends, and product reviews that help drive smarter business decisions.

## Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis on Sephora Reviews

a. Objective

This project analyzes customer reviews from Sephora using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment and uncover key themes affecting customer satisfaction.

b. Key Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)

- Sentiment analysis (model used, e.g., VADER, BERT, or TextBlob)

- Visualization of sentiment distribution

- Insights derived from the analysis

c. Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- NLTK/spaCy/TextBlob

- Matplotlib/Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

d. Key Insights:

- Higher star ratings align with more positive sentiment.

- Longer reviews tend to express stronger sentiment (positive or negative).

- Mid/high-priced products slightly outperform low-priced ones in ratings.

- Skincare and Makeup categories have higher sentiment than Haircare.

- Price alone does not significantly determine sentiment (ANOVA test shows weak effect).

## Project 2 - Walmart Sales Analysis & Forecasting

a. Objective

To analyze Walmart’s historical sales data to uncover key patterns, understand how external factors (fuel price, temperature, unemployment rate, holidays) influence sales performance, and build a predictive model to forecast future sales trends.

b. Key Features

- Conducted data cleaning and transformation in SQL and Power BI for accuracy and consistency.

- Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize time-based and factor-based sales patterns.

- Performed comparative analysis to assess the impact of holidays, fuel prices, and economic indicators on sales.

- Implemented forecasting models using Power BI’s built-in predictive analytics to project future sales.

c. Technologies Used

- SQL – for data extraction, aggregation, and metric calculation

- Power BI – for dashboard design, DAX calculations, and forecasting visualization

- Excel – for initial data exploration and validation

d. Key Insights:

- Sales Timing: Sales are consistently higher in the first half of each month (Days 1–15), indicating stronger early-month purchasing behavior.

- Seasonal Patterns: June, July, and August rank among the top months for sales, showing strong summer seasonality.

- Holiday Impact: Presence of holidays increases sales by about 8 million USD, but overall sales contributions remain nearly balanced between holiday and non-holiday periods (~50/50).

- Focus marketing campaigns and promotions in early months and summer seasons to capitalize on peak demand.

- Plan inventory and staffing ahead of holiday periods and summer months.
