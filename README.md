# Anuna's - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi! I’m Anuna, a recent Master’s graduate in Business Analytics with a background in Economics. I’m passionate about turning data into actionable insights and using analytics to solve real-world business problems.

During my studies and projects, I’ve worked extensively with Python, Excel, and data visualization tools to analyze datasets, perform statistical analyses, and communicate findings effectively. I enjoy exploring datasets related to consumer behavior, marketing trends, and product reviews, and sharing insights that drive smarter decisions.

## Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis on Sephora Reviews

a. Objective

This project analyzes customer reviews from Sephora using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment and uncover key themes affecting customer satisfaction.

b. Key Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)

- Sentiment analysis (model used, e.g., VADER, BERT, or TextBlob)

- Visualization of sentiment distribution

- Insights derived from the analysis

c. Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- NLTK/spaCy/TextBlob

- Matplotlib/Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

d. Key Insights:

- Higher star ratings align with more positive sentiment.

- Longer reviews tend to express stronger sentiment (positive or negative).

- Mid/high-priced products slightly outperform low-priced ones in ratings.

- Skincare and Makeup categories have higher sentiment than Haircare.

- Price alone does not significantly determine sentiment (ANOVA test shows weak effect).
